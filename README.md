# ResumeGameProj

Welcome to my first react app! My name is Brandon Cheung and I am a recent computer science graduate. This is a interactive resume or game
that I hope showcases my technical and personal skills to any potential employers. This is the first of many self-produced app that I wish
to create, so I there may be problems with this one, but I am proud of what I have created. Any feedback is welcome.
